//! Passphrase and danger-mode policies.
//!
//! Security policy enforcement for authority operations.
//!
//! Planned features:
//! - Passphrase complexity requirements and validation
//! - Danger-mode guards for destructive operations (revocation, rotation)
//! - Dual-control requirements for high-privilege operations (Skull/Master keys)
//! - Audit logging integration for policy violations
//!
//! Current status: Stub implementation pending security requirements finalization.
