## 2. Detailed Workstreams

### 2.1 Authority Chain Completion (Ignite)

**Objectives**
- Finalize rotation/revocation flows for I/D keys.
- Harden nonce generation & proof renewal scheduler.
- Expand CLI coverage (rotate, revoke, import, export).

**Key Tasks**
1. Implement crypto-secure nonce generation (hub::random_ext) [‚úÖ]
2. AuthorityChain graph validation + dependent key discovery [üü°]
3. Rotation command with manifest generation & tombstones [‚è≥]
4. Revocation workflow with CLI prompts + policy hooks [‚è≥]
5. Proof renewal background job (cron or external trigger) [‚è≥]

**Risks & Mitigations**
- *Risk*: Proof scheduler timing drift ‚Üí Mitigation: allow manual `--force-renew` CLI.
- *Risk*: Manifest tampering ‚Üí Mitigation: digest verification enforced in CLI + audits.

### 2.2 Cage Enhancements

**Objectives**
- Ensure Cage exposes recipient management APIs consumed by Ignite rotation.
- Improve observability (structured logs, exit codes) for automation.

**Key Tasks**
1. CRUD manager integration tests with Ignite-generated keysets [üü°]
2. Recipient scoping tags (path-based) [‚è≥]
3. Clamp mode improvements & status reporting [‚è≥]

### 2.3 Unified Padlock CLI

**Objectives**
- Provide a single binary (`padlock`) that orchestrates ignite + cage flows.
- Deliver guided onboarding (bootstrap) and rotation commands with guardrails.

**Key Tasks**
1. Re-export common prelude (env checks, logging) [üü°]
2. Command scaffolding: `padlock init`, `padlock ignite`, `padlock rotate`, `padlock status` [‚è≥]
3. Add JSON output mode for automation [‚è≥]
4. Integration tests spanning bootstrap ‚Üí CI unlock ‚Üí rotation [‚è≥]

### 2.4 Policy & Audit Layer

**Objectives**
- Express rotation cadence, expiry, dual-control requirements in a central config.
- Provide CLI/API to inspect audit history across repos.

**Key Tasks**
1. Policy schema (`metadata/policy.toml`) + loader [‚è≥]
2. Dual-control enforcement for Skull/Master actions [‚è≥]
3. Audit log aggregation + search CLI (`padlock audit list`) [‚è≥]
4. Manifest/proof webhook integration (Slack/Jira) [‚è≥]

### 2.5 Documentation & Enablement

**Objectives**
- Deliver cohesive documentation for onboarding, operations, and incident response.

**Key Tasks**
1. Update README + architecture diagrams (this doc) [‚úÖ]
2. Runbook for common operations (bootstrap, rotation, recovery) [üü°]
3. Incident drill playbook (Skull unlock, mass revocation) [‚è≥]
4. Video walkthrough / workshop for pilot teams [‚è≥]

## 3. Dependency Map

```
AuthorityChain graph ‚Üí Rotation CLI ‚Üí Manifest pipeline ‚Üí Cage recipient updates ‚Üí Policy enforcement ‚Üí Audit surfacing
```

- Rotation CLI cannot ship until AuthorityChain validation + dependent key discovery are stable.
- Padlock CLI beta requires Ignite rotation APIs and Cage recipient tagging.
- Policy enforcement depends on manifest/rotation signals and CLI exit code reliability.

## 4. Metrics & Checkpoints

| Metric | Target | Checkpoint |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Repo bootstrap time | ‚â§ 10 min | M2 exit |
| Rotation success rate | ‚â• 99% automated | M3 exit |
| Mean manifest generation time | ‚â§ 1 min | M3 exit |
| Proof renewal freshness | 100% renewed ‚â•12h before expiry | M4 exit |
| Pilot satisfaction (NPS) | ‚â• +40 | M5 exit |

---

## 5. Open Issues & Follow-ups

- Define storage encryption strategy for private key blobs (Cage integration vs. OS keyring).
- Decide on scheduler runtime (cron job, systemd timer, Kubernetes job).
- Establish incident escalation contacts and on-call rotations for Padlock services.
- Confirm compliance requirements for manifest retention and secure deletion.

## 6. Change Log

- **2025-01-12** ‚Äì Initial roadmap drafted post Ignite CLI MVP (Padlock Core Team).
- Subsequent changes tracked via Git history and release notes.
