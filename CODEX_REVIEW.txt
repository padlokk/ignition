# Codex Session Review – Ignite Scaffold (2025-09-27)

## Mission Snapshot
- Repo: `prods/padlokk/ignition`
- Working branch: `main`
- Scope: Build RSB-compliant scaffold for the new Ignite authority CLI and document module/test expectations.

## Accomplished
1. **Project Metadata**
   - Renamed crate to `ignite`, set description/repo metadata.
   - Dependency graph trimmed to essentials (chrono, sha2, ed25519-dalek, hub’s re-exports). No direct serde/rand/base64.

2. **Module Skeleton (per MODULE_SPEC)**
   - `src/lib.rs` exposes `IgniteResult` + `ignite::IgniteError`.
   - `src/ignite/` orchestrator with placeholder submodules:
     - `utils.rs`, `guards.rs`, `macros.rs`, `prelude.rs`, `prelude_dev.rs`.
     - `authority/{mod.rs, chain.rs, proofs.rs, manifests.rs, storage/*}`.
     - `cli/{mod.rs, commands.rs, context.rs}`.
     - `security/{mod.rs, policy.rs}`.
     - `logging/mod.rs`.
   - Guard helper `ensure_age_available` in `ignite::guards` (discussed but not yet wired).

3. **Tests**
   - `tests/unit/deps.rs`: sanity check that hub re-exports `serde_json`, `uuid`, and `rand`.

4. **Docs**
   - `docs/ref/IGNITE_CONCEPTS.md`: added module layout overview.
   - `docs/ref/IGNITE_CLI.md`: documented RSB entry point, module locations, and exclusion of hub `cli-ext`.
   - `docs/ref/IGNITE_MANIFEST.md`: notes the hub dependency sanity test.

5. **Backlog/Roadmap**
   - Roadmap Milestone 2.1 includes age binary guard.
   - Backlog item `IG-0208 — Age Binary Guard` added.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Move real logic from `code_ref/` into the new modules (authority chain, manifests, proofs, storage).
- Implement RSB CLI entry at `src/bin/cli_ignite.rs` and connect `ignite::cli` handlers.
- Flesh out storage adapters (XDG + local) and integrate dependency guards.
- Build manifest/proof tests per specs.
- Remove the old `code_ref` references once migrated.


## Padlock Context
- Ignite is one pillar of Padlock’s security stack (built alongside Cage).
- Purpose: manage X→M→R→I→D authority lifecycles and expose automation-friendly CLI hooks.
- Cage handles PTY automation + file encryption; Ignite focuses on key hierarchy, manifests, and validation so Padlock repos can grant/revoke access safely.
- Legacy docs referenced: `docs/ref/padlock/` (FEATURES, PRD, CONCEPTS) for larger project context.
- UAT_AUTHORITY_CHAIN_001 judged "CONDITIONAL PASS" but should be treated as **fail** until storage, nonce generation, CLI commands, and tests exist.

## Key References
- `docs/ref/IGNITE_CONCEPTS.md` – overall mental model + module layout.
- `docs/ref/IGNITE_MANIFEST.md` – manifest schema and test requirements.
- `docs/ref/IGNITE_PROOFS.md` – canonical payload and rotation workflow.
- `docs/ref/IGNITE_CLI.md` – CLI architecture and harness.
- `docs/ref/rsb/MODULE_SPEC.md`, `PRELUDE_POLICY.md`, `TEST_ORGANIZATION.md` – scaffolding standards.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Actual logic still lives in `code_ref/`; plan to migrate incrementally. Keep module boundaries per spec (orchestrator thin, helpers/test adapters isolated).
- When wiring the CLI, rely on RSB macros (bootstrap/options!/dispatch!) and hub for third-party deps (serde_json via hub::data_ext, etc.).
- Age dependency guard is planned but not yet used—tie it into CLI startup soon.
